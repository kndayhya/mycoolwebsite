	<h1 style='color:#800000'>Music That Means A Lot To Me <3 </h1>

	<!-- short sentences introducing what the website is about-->
	<p> Here's a collection of songs that mean a lot to me.</p>
	<p> Every song here holds a special memory.</p>
	<p> I still listen to the same artists as I did in high school.</p>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;"> "Somewhere in these eyes, I'm on your Side.." </h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> The first 'Beach House' song I ever heard was 'Space Song'.</p>
	<p>This brings back so many highschool memories. During lockdown when school was remote, 'Space Song' accompanied me as I made Quizlet flashcards for my AP Pyschology exam. </p>
	<p> I used to fixate on a few songs, so I never really explored their full discography until my sophomore year of college.</p>
	<p> That's when I discovered my new fav song from them called 'PPP'.</p>
	<p> Beach House's ethereal sound never fails to tug at my heart strings</p><p> Currently listening to 'Silver Soul' as I type this :P</p>

	<!--the line below serves to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> Another favorite is 'The Cranberries'. I have so many favorites from them, but one song that really stood out to me was 'When You're Gone.'</p>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> I had to include 'Mother Mother'. I attended their concert last july and I think it made me love them even more</p>
	<p> This album has so many of my favorite Mother Mother songs.</p>
	<p> 'Burning Pile', 'Arms Tonite', 'Sleep Awake', 'Wrecking Ball'</p>

	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;">"In my silence, my time is wasted, I'm not a fountain nor a traveler"</h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> Hamid El Shaeri is a very talented singer, songwriter, and producer.</p>
	<p> A remix of his song 'Ouda' suddenly became very popular on Tiktok.</p>
	<p> I love listening to 'Ouda', but I find that Hamid has so many other songs that I love even more.</p>
	<p> I'm constantly discovering more of his music. My current favorites being 'Dari Damouak' and 'Ya Reit.'</p>
	<p> Hamid is a very important figure in Arabic Pop and he has been around since the 80s and composed a lot of hits for many artists such as Amr Diab</p>
	<p> It's nice to see him finally getting the recognition he deserves.</p>

	<!--image of Tame Impala's album-->

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;"> "I was doing fine without You, till I saw your face"</h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> I love every single song Tame Impala has released</p>
	<p> the best seven minutes and fourty six seconds are those spent listening to 'Let It Happen'</p>
	<p> it may be tempting to skip the chorus ... but trust me when I say that each part of the song is worth listening to.</p>
	<p> Another honorable mention is 'The Less I Know the Better.'</p>
	<p> It's Tame Impala's number one song on Spotify with over 1.8 billion views.</p>
	<p> With just one click, I'm suddenly fourteen again, listening to that song.</p>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;"> "Kristen come right back..."</h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> I don't even know where to begin...</p>
	<p> 'Cigarettes After Sex' is ,without a doubt, my favorite band. No matter how many artists I come across,</p>
	<p> there's something about their music that remains so distinctive and beautiful</p>
	<p> Listening to their music feels like a warm hug, a  comforting shoulder to lean on. </p>
	<p> The first ever CAS song I ever heard was 'Apocalypse.' I remember being so hypnotized by it. It was, and still is, a very beautiful piece of art.</p>
	<p> Back then, I'd strictly listen to 'Space Song' and 'Apocalypse' whenever I studied</p>
	<p> During orientation week, when I was still getting to the area near Tandon, I stumbled upon the McNally Jackson bookstore in CityPoint. </p>
	<p>That's when I found my next favorite cas song: Touch </p>
	<p> The music was playing so faintly, and I remember desperately hoping my phone's song detection would work . I didn't want to lose the song</p>
	<p> 'Touch' later became a staple in my song rotation during my first semester in college, Spring 2024.</p>
	<p> 'You're All I want', 'John Wayne', 'Motion Picture Soundtrack', 'Heavenly', and 'K.' are some of my favorites.</p>
	<p> I'm a little biased when it comes to 'K' bc its my intial <3</p>


	<!--image of Coldplay's album-->
	<img src="coldplay.jpg" width=250 height=250>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;"> "But I promise you this, I'll always look out for you"</h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> Speaking of McNally Jackson, I stumbled upon ‘Trouble’ by Coldplay while browsing the books there, and it quickly became part of my playlist</p>
	<p> A lot of Coldplay's songs have sentimental meanings to me.</p>
	<p> 'Clocks' was played in my highschool graduation video where we showcased our memories as a class</p>
	<p> 'Hymn for the Weekend' reminds me of my childhood because I listened to this song with my siblings and my childhood best friends </p>
	<p> 'Trouble' is part of my freshman year soundtrack</p>

	<!--image of The Strokes' album-->
	<img src="the_strokes.jpg" width=250 height=250>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;">"Drums please, Fab"</h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> I love 'The Strokes'</p>
	<p> Some of my favorite songs are 'Ode to the Mets', 'Selfless', 'Call it Fate, Call it Karma', and 'Is this it'</p>
	<p> I was first introduced to 'The Strokes' during high school when I listened to their song called 'The Adults are Talking.'</p>
	<p> But it wasn't until last spring when I explored more of their music.</p>

	<!--image of Daft Punk's Album RAM-->
	<img src="daft_punk.jpg" width=250 height=250>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;"> "And we will never be alone againn cause it doesn't happen everyday"</h2>


	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> I only recently realized that Daft Punk had a hand in so many of my favorite songs.</p>
	<p> They either featured them or were produced by them.</p>
	<p> songs like 'Get Lucky' and 'Starboy' were associated with Daft Punk</p>
	<p> Though last September was when my fixation on their music began, </p>
	<p>specifically when I heard the song 'Instant Crush' which featured 'The Strokes'' lead singer Julian Casablancas.</p>
	<p> I love 'Instant Crush', 'Infinty Repeating', and 'Giorgio by Moroder.'</p>

	<!--image of Cairokee's album Roma-->
	<img src="cairokee.jpg" width=250 height=250>

	<!--Header with a lyric from the artist-->
	<h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Handwriting', cursive;color:#800000;"> "Why do I like them? They're a past that's gone and done"</h2>

	<!--the lines below serve to portray my connection to the artist/why I like their music-->
	<p> Cairokee is an Egyptian Rock band that gained prominence in recent years</p>
	<p> Cairokee's music has been so inspiring, espcially their album 'Roma'</p>
	<p> Roma features all of my fav songs from them, including 'Basrah w Atooh', 'Roma', and 'Ana Negm'</p>
	<p> They're genuinely one of my favorite bands and I'm so glad I got to see them live in my hometown</p>
	<p> Experiencing their music live deepened my love for their songs, I really recommend their music</p>
